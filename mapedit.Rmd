```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(sf)
library(mapedit)
library(leaflet)
```

# Load data

```{r}
seaweed <- read_sf("data/seaweed_range_lines.shp")
```

Open up leaflet map and begin building lines, polygons or points. When done click finished and you have a list. To get the final as a simple feature select the data $finished.

```{r}

seaweed_lines <- editMap(leaflet() %>% addTiles())
sw_lines <- seaweed_lines$finished

#save
write_sf(sw_lines, "../../Data/seaweed_range_lines", driver = "ESRI Shapefile")
```

Can I edit a shapefile? (answer: yes!)

Let's edit the seaweed lines shapefile
```{r}
new_lines <- mapview(seaweed) %>%
  editMap("seaweed")
```
